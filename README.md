# **Prad Lamichhane - Data-Analyst-Portfolio**
## **About**
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Prad Lamichhane and I am a Data Analyst. I have a diverse background in ranging from Banking to Dairy, Health Care, and Transportation in both Australia and abroad. I have recently completed Data Analytics Bootcamp from Generation Australia. I have developed a strong foundation in business and economics and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

During my bootcamp, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience using various tools like Python, SQL, Shell, Git and PowerBI for the purpose of Data Analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics related topics.
